Repetition using intervals
The repetition is done on basis of intervals that are gradually being prolonged. It works like this: At your first day, you really have to cram new materials properly as you normally would. The second day (but no later than in 24 hours, ideally after 12 hours) you come back to the study material and revise it. Because you’re revising the information in the moment you still remember it and only minor details might get lost, this revision can take only 5-10 minutes.

After the first repetition, the second revision is after 3 days. If you still remember the material after that, the third repetition is after 7 days. Ideal intervals are as follows:  Day 0 (cramming) -> day 1 (first repetition within 24 hours) -> day 3 (second repetition)-> 7-> 21 -> 30 -> 45 -> 60. After several such repetitions, your brain should finally evaluate that it’s something worth remembering and puts it into your long-term memory. Of course, if you start actively using newly acquired things, they become impossible to forget.
